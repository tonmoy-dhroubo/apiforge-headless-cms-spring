# Project Notes

- The original package name `com.apiforge.apiforge-headless-cms` is invalid; this project uses `com.apiforge.apiforge_headless_cms`.
- The project POM overrides inherited `<license>` and `<developers>` entries from the parent. Remove those overrides only if you want the parent values.
